 # this name contain 6 alphabets but in python it shows 5 bcz in programming language counting starts from 0.
# we can also applying negative counting like -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6. And negative counting starts from -1 and on the right side of the string.
# length of this string is 6. Bcz it contain 6 letters.

# we can also do this 
print(len(d))              # len means length of the string.

e = d[0:3]          # it means start from 0 till 3. And 3 is excluding.
print(e)             # it prints 'sha' 

character1 = d[1]        
print(character1)       # it means print character number 1 of the string d. thats is 'h'.
