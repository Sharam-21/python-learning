a = input("Enter number:")
b = input("Enter number:")
print(a + b) 
# if a = 1 and b =2, then answer will be 12. Bcz the data type of variable is string.
# When 2 string is add. Then answer of both variable is written side by side. Thats why answer is 12.

c = int(input("Enter number 1:"))
d = int(input("Enter number 2:"))
print(c + d)

# Now the answer will be integer bcz we used int.
# Now you put any value the type is integer and answer is right if a +b, the answer is 3.
